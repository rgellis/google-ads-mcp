# Google Ads MCP Server

An unofficial Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for Google Ads APIs using the official Python SDK.

## Overview

This project provides an MCP server that wraps the Google Ads API v23, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with Google Ads accounts through a standardized interface. The server uses the official Google Ads Python SDK (`google-ads==30.0.0`) with full type annotations for robust and reliable API interactions.

## Features

- **Full Type Safety**: Implemented with strict type annotations using pyright
- **SDK-Based**: Built on top of the official Google Ads Python SDK for reliability
- **100% API Coverage**: Implements all 111 Google Ads v23 services with every RPC method
- **MCP Compliant**: Follows the Model Context Protocol specification for LLM integration
- **Async Support**: Leverages FastMCP for asynchronous operations
- **100% Test Coverage**: All 113 service files have tests (774+ tests passing)
- **Intentionally Skipped Fields**: `AdditionalApplicationInfo` fields (`insights_application_info`, `application_info`, `reach_application_info`) are not exposed across 21 RPCs in 4 services (audience_insights, benchmarks, content_creator_insights, reach_plan). These are internal Google application tracking metadata used to identify the calling application — not relevant for third-party MCP callers. See `FIELD_COVERAGE_AUDIT.md` for the full list.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/promobase/google-ads-mcp.git
cd google-ads-mcp

# Install dependencies using uv

export GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
export GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
export GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN="your_refresh_token"
```

## Usage
